_i.e._ How to make sense of the results of each of the simulations.

# Experiment 1: Backsolving $\vec{\mathbf{v}}(t_i)$ from $\left. \frac {\mathrm{d} \vec{\mathbf{x}}(t)} {\mathrm{d}t} \right|_{t_i}$ Approximated from Smoothed $\vec{\mathbf{x}}(t_i)$ Time Series Data
In a sentence, we need to visualize the **flux network over the experiment**.
